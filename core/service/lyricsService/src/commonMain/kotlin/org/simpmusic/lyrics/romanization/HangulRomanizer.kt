/**
 * Revised Romanization of Korean, the South Korean government standard since 2000.
 *
 * Hangul needs no dictionary: a syllable block is composed ARITHMETICALLY from three slots, so it
 * decomposes the same way. Every one of the 11 172 blocks is
 * `0xAC00 + (initial * 21 + medial) * 28 + final`, which is why the three tables below — 19, 21
 * and 28 entries — cover the entire script exactly.
 *
 * What it does NOT do is the full set of assimilation rules. RR specifies how a final consonant
 * and the next initial change EACH OTHER, and the common cases are handled in [applyLiaison];
 * the rarer ones (palatalisation before 이, tensing after obstruents) are left alone. They change
 * a consonant here and there, not legibility, and getting them all right needs the morpheme
 * boundaries that only a Korean analyzer knows.
