/**
 * Cyrillic → Latin for the seven Cyrillic languages this feature supports.
 *
 * They share one alphabet and romanize it differently, so each gets its own table. The shared
 * letters are factored into [BASE] and every language declares only what it does DIFFERENTLY —
 * which is also the honest way to read this file: the overrides are exactly the disagreements.
 *
 * Standards followed, one per language, all of them the national or de-facto official system:
 *  - Russian: BGN/PCGN, the system used on maps and passports.
 *  - Ukrainian: the 2010 national system (и → y, г → h — the two that most often come out wrong).
 *  - Serbian: Gaj's Latin, which is not a transliteration at all but Serbia's OTHER alphabet, so
 *    it is exactly one-to-one and never ambiguous.
 *  - Bulgarian: the Streamlined System, official since 2009 (ъ → a, х → h).
 *  - Belarusian: the 2007 national system (ў → u with a breve, г → h).
 *  - Kyrgyz: BGN/PCGN.
 *  - Macedonian: the national system, which shares Serbian's letters but not its ѓ/ќ.
