/**
 * Devanagari (Hindi) and Gurmukhi (Punjabi) → Latin, in the Hunterian system — India's official
 * one, and the one without diacritics, which matters here because the reader is trying to sing
 * along rather than study phonology.
 *
 * These two are **abugidas**, not alphabets, and that is the whole difficulty: a consonant letter
 * already carries an inherent `a`, so क alone is "ka", not "k". Three things can happen to that
 * inherent vowel and a plain lookup table handles none of them:
 *
 *  - a MATRA (dependent vowel sign) replaces it — कि is "ki", not "kai".
 *  - a VIRAMA (्) deletes it — क् is "k", which is how consonant clusters are written.
 *  - nothing follows, and it stays.
 *
 * So the transliteration is a small state machine over the string, not a map.
