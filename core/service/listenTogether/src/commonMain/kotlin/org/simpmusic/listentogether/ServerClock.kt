 * Maps the server's wall clock onto this device's monotonic clock, from ping/pong round trips.
 *
 * Every device in a room runs its own clock with its own drift, so "play at position 1234" is
 * meaningless until both ends agree what time it is. Each pong carries the client's send time and
 * the server's receive/send times, which is enough to estimate one-way latency and therefore the
 * offset between the two clocks.
 *
 * [elapsedRealtime] must be MONOTONIC — a wall clock that an NTP correction can step backwards
 * would make [positionAt] jump. Callers inject it so each platform passes its own source.
