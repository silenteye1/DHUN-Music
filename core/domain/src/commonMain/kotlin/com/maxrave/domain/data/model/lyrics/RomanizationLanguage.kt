/**
 * The twelve languages whose lyrics can be shown in Latin script.
 *
 * The list is of LANGUAGES, not scripts, and the difference is why each entry exists separately:
 * seven of them are written in Cyrillic and share one alphabet while romanizing it differently —
 * Ukrainian `и` is `y` where Russian `и` is `i`; Macedonian keeps Serbian's `ј` but adds `ѓ`/`ќ`.
 * A single "Cyrillic" entry would be wrong for six of the seven.
 *
 * Lives in `domain` rather than beside the romanizers in `lyricsService`, because both sides need
 * it and they cannot see each other: `data` depends on `lyricsService` with `implementation`, so
 * the dependency stops there and never reaches `composeApp` — which is exactly the layering rule
 * working as intended. Anything the UI and a service must BOTH name belongs here.
