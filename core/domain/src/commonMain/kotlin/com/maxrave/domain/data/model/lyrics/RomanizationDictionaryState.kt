 * Where the Japanese romanization dictionary stands on this device.
 *
 * Japanese is the one language whose romanizer needs a ~13 MB morphological dictionary, which is
 * no longer packaged inside the Android APK — it is fetched once, on demand, after the user turns
 * Japanese on. The other eleven languages never leave [READY] territory conceptually and do not
 * consult this state at all; platforms that still bundle the dictionary (Desktop) report [READY]
 * from the start.
